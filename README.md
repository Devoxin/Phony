# Phony
The Discord phone bot that allows you to voice-call other guilds.

## Phony's "To Do" list
```
- Extend call timeout to 1 minute
- Maybe pickup tone so if tabbed out of Discord, know when someone picks up
- Hangup tone too?
- Voicemail set/view/playback on call timeout w/ ability to leave voice messages and play them later, with channel notifications and/or nickname notifications
- Possibility to allow adding extra guilds to the call (multi-guild calling?)
- Extend phonebook name column
- Custom numbers
- Show who you're calling
- Show call length during call

Done/Testing:
- Ability to set phone to "speakerphone" so multiple/all users in VC can speak to receiver(s)
- Add dial tones
